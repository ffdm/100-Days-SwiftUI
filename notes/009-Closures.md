# Day 9
In Swift, you can assign functions to variable, pass functions to
functions, and even return functions from functions.
Ex: Copying a function
```
func greetUser() {
    print("Hi there!")
}

greetUser()

var greetCopy = greetUser
greetCopy()
```
To skip creating a function and just make a variable with
functionality, we create a closure expression:
```
let greetUser = {
    print("Hi there!")
}
greetUser()
```
To send our closure arguments and return a value:
```
let greetUser = { (name: String) -> String in
    "Hi \(name)!"
}
```
Functions have types as well. If we were to write the type
annotation for the `greetUser()` function we just wrote, it
would be: `var greetCopy: (String) -> String = greetUser`. 
Meaning,
- It takes a string argument
- Returns a string
- Note: no parameters (previous version of greetUser) written as:
    `var greetCopy: () -> Void = 
- Note: parameter names not included in type
- Note: Void return type can also be written as `()`.
## How is this useful?
Example: custom storting function. Suppose we had an array of 
names of volleyball players on a team and we want to sort them 
alphabetically, but we want the team captain to always be first.
We can create a custom sorting predicate and pass that to our
sorting function:
```
let team = ["Gloria", "Suzanne", "Piper", "Tiffany", "Tasha"]
let sortedTeam = team.sorted()
print(sortedTeam)

func captainFirstSorted(name1: String, name2: String) -> Bool {
    if name1 == "Suzanne" {
        return true
    } else if name2 == "Suzanne" {
        return false
    }

    return name1 < name2
}

let captainFirstTeam = team.sorted(by: captainFirstSorted)
print(captainFirstTeam)
```
This demonstrates the ability to pass functions into other
functions. Since a closure is basically a function without a name,
we can pass a closure into a function as well. Here is an example
of how we can accomplish the same thing as above using closures:
```
let captainFirstTeam = team.sorted(by:
    { (name1: String, name2: String) -> Bool in
        if name1 == "Suzanne" {
            return true
        } else if name2 == "Suzanne" {
            return false
        }

        return name 1 < name2
    }
)
```
Since we know by the definition of `sorted()` that our closure
function argument must take in two strings and return a boolean,
we don't actually need to include that information in our closure.
We can rewrite the code as so:
```
let captainFirstTeam = team.sorted(by:
    { name1, name2 in
        if name1 == "Suzanne" {
            return true
        } else if name2 == "Suzanne" {
            return false
        }

        return name 1 < name2
    }
)
```
This is called *trailing closure syntax*.
We can shorten this syntax even further.
Rather than passing in our closure as an argument, we can "go
ahead and start the closure directly" by removing `(by:` from the
start and the final closing parenthesis. 
```
let captainFirstTeam = team.sorted { name1, name2 in
        if name1 == "Suzanne" {
            return true
        } else if name2 == "Suzanne" {
            return false
        }

        return name 1 < name2
    }

```
Swift also defines parameter names for us. `$0` for the first
parameter, `$1` for the next, etc. So we can remove the `name1,
name2 in` line entirely.
- Note: Swift does not let you define parameter names and use
    shorthand parameters in the same function.
```
let captainFirstTeam = team.sorted { 
        if $0 == "Suzanne" {
            return true
        } else if $1 == "Suzanne" {
            return false
        }

        return $1 < $2
    }
)
```
To use a trailing closure when calling the functions, make sure
the final function parameter is a function. Then you can use the
trailing closure syntax to get rid of the final parameter.
## Writing functions with function parameters
We want to use the function type annotation when specifying the
type of our parameters. Here is a function that creates an array
of integers generated by a specified function:
```
func makeArray(size: Int, using generator: () -> Int) -> [Int] {
    var numbers = [Int]()

    for _ in 0..<size {
        let newNumber = generator()
        numbers.append(newNumber)
    }

    return numbers
}
```
Now we can call use this function to create an array like so:
```
let rolls = makeArray(size: 50) {
    Int.random(in: 1...20)
}

print(rolls)
```
Or we could use a dedicated function instead of a closure:
```
func generateNumber() -> Int {
    Int.random(in: 1...20)
}

let newRolls = makeArray(size: 50, using: generateNumber)
print(newRolls)
```
## Multiple function parameters
You can actually also accept multiple function and *STILL* use 
trailing closures. You just have to specify multiple trailing
closures uring the external parameter names of the function:
```
func doImportantWork(first: () -> Void, second: () -> Void, third: () -> Void) {
    print("About to start first work")
    first()
    print("About to start second work")
    second()
    print("About to start third work")
    third()
    print("Done!")
}

doImportantWork {
    print("First work")
} second: {
    print("Second work")
} third: {
    print("Third work")
}
```
