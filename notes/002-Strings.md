# Day 2
## Booleans
- Don't have arithmetric operators
- Have ! operator
- .toggle() function, flips boolean
## Joining strings
- Concatonate with +
### String interpolation (more efficient)
```
let name = "Bill"
let age = 25
let message = "Hello, I'm \(name) and I'm \(age) years old."
print(message)
```
You can even put in calculations
```
print("Hello \(5+5)")
```
