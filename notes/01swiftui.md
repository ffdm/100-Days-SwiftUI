# What is SwiftUI?
## Imperative UI
Might call a function when a button is clicked, and read a value
and show a label in that function, modifying the user inteface
based on what's happening.
## Declarative UI
Lets us tell iOS what all of the possible states are for our app.
We let SwiftUI change between the layouts for us. SwiftUI also
acts as a cross-platform user interface.
# Difference between IB/Storyboards?
IB and Swift are separate. SwiftUI is a Swift-only framework.
